## ðŸ“œ Custom XSS Patterns for `gf` (from coffinxp)

In the repository, we provide a custom `.gf` file with preconfigured **XSS patterns** to streamline vulnerability detection. The `.gf` file contains patterns specifically designed to search for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** payloads across various web application attack surfaces.

### How It Works

- **`gf` Patterns**: `gf` is a tool that allows for easy discovery of vulnerabilities by matching predefined patterns against URLs, parameters, and input fields. The provided `.gf` file contains a set of XSS-related patterns (stored in JSON format), which are essential for identifying potential XSS injection points in web applications.
  
- **How to Use**:  
  The `.gf` file can be used with the `gf` tool to automatically identify possible **XSS vulnerabilities** in the URLs you are scanning.

### Example Usage

After cloning the repository, you can run `gf` with the provided XSS patterns as follows:

```bash
cat <urls-file> | gf xss
